Hello! I'm eristelle, or Eris for short. Of course, my thirteen year old self named myself Eris eons ago because of the whole Greek goddess of chaos and discord spiel, but in reality, my physical size relative to that of the average human's about the same as that of Eris the dwarf planet to that of the average planet. 

I'm a chemist who likes to pretend I can code. 

If my code gives you migraines, I hereby apologise in advance - it tends to have that effect on people.
